 Dependencies:  See INCLUDES section
 Processor:     PIC18, PIC24, dsPIC33, or PIC32 USB Microcontrollers
 Hardware:      This demo is natively intended to be used on Microchip USB demo
                boards supported by the MCHPFSUSB stack.  See release notes for
                support matrix.  The firmware may be modified for use on
                other USB platforms by editing this file (HardwareProfile.h)
                and adding a new hardware specific 
                HardwareProfile - [platform name].h file.
